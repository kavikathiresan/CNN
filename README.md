# CNN Classification
## Custom Binary Classification:
Letâ€™s build our own custom CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model all from scratch by training and testing it with our custom image dataset. This is mostly considered a more impressive work rather than training a pre-trained CNN model to classify images.custom dataset is a dataset that is either prepared all by yourself like you are going out there in the city and clicking photographs to gather and identify the images.Binary has 2 classes so we are going to see how to make your own CNN binary image classifier which can classify Dog and Cat images
## Custom Multilabel Classification:
Multilabel Classification is used when there are two or more classes and the data we want to classify may belong to none of the classes or all of them at the same time

# Transfer Learning:
Transfer learning in a CNN refers to using a pre-trained model on a similar task as a starting point for training a new model on a different task.
## VVG16
. VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network that is 16 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database 
## VVG19
-VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database [1]. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories
# Face Detection
-Open cv frameworks
