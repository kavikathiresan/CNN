# Face Detection 
Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in the 2001 paper.Here we will work with face detection. Initially, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the classifier.
